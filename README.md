# SimpleAssemblyStopwatchProgram
# Author: mvanditc @ github.com

This is a simple stopwatch program I developed using ARMv7-based Assembly language. The program is designed to work on an online FPGA emulator (https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc). You can also run the following program on a physical FPGA board, given that you have a 6-digit 7-segment display, 4 push buttons, a switch, and a way to upload the code to the board.

Instructions on use are located in comments at the top of the program file: stopWatchAssemblyCode.s
